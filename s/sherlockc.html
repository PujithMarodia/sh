    <p><Span>Sherlock Holmes</Span> is a  Known as a 'consulting detective' in the stories, Holmes is known for a proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, 
        which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including  Scotland Yard. Amongst other foibles, Holmes had a penchant for papier maché.</p>

    <p>First appearing in print in 1887 in 'A Study in Scarlet', the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with 'A Scandal 
        in Bohemia' in 1891. Additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. </p>

    <p><Span>Professor James Moriarty</Span> the arch-enemy of Sherlock Holmes, is a mathematics professor turned the world's only 'consulting criminal'. His genius is equal to, if not perhaps greater than, Holmes himself.</p>

     <p>Moriarty is a machiavellian criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the 'Napoleon of crime'. Conan Doyle borrowed this phrase from a Scotland Yard inspector who was referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind, who is one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based.</p>
    
    <p>The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Conan Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes, and only featured in two of the Sherlock Holmes stories.</p>

    <p><Span>Dr John H. Watson</Span>  is a medical doctor, formerly in the British Army. He was married to Mary Watson and is arguably the only friend and confidant of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

    <p>In the debut Holmes story 'A Study in Scarlet', Watson, as the narrator, describes meeting Holmes, their subsequent sharing of rooms at 221B Baker Street, his attempts to discover the 
    profession of his taciturn companion, Holmes's eventual taking of Watson into his confidence, and the events surrounding their first case together. Watson describes Holmes and his methods in too romantic and 
    sentimental a manner for Holmes' taste. In time, they become close friends.</p>

     <p>Whilst Mycroft – Holmes' elder brother (by seven years) – is telling Sherlock about Irene, he states that she is a dominatrix who gives out 'recreational scolding' to people. She has been in the middle of two 
     political scandals in recent years, one of them involving a famous author, in which she had an affair with both sides.</p>
